## Completed Task: 1.0 Set up financial data models and CSV data processing

This session focused on establishing the foundational data layer for the Financial Performance Dashboard. All sub-tasks associated with Task 1.0 in `tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md` were completed.

### Summary of Work:

1.  **Data Modeling (`src/core/types/financial.ts`):**
    *   Defined TypeScript interfaces for core financial metrics (`FinancialMetrics`).
    *   Created interfaces for `Country` and `ProfitCenter` data structures.
    *   Added a `FinancialData` interface to represent a single row from the source CSV.
    *   Introduced an `AggregatedFinancials` interface for summarized data.
    *   Established a `TimeSeriesData` structure to hold monthly aggregated values.

2.  **Data Processing and Aggregation (`src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts`):**
    *   Implemented `aggregateFinancials` to sum up financial data records.
    *   Created `calculateCountryLevelMetrics` to aggregate the raw data by country and calculate key metrics like Operating Margin and Return on Equity.
    *   Added `calculateProfitCenterMetrics` to perform similar aggregations for profit centers within a specific country.

3.  **CSV Parsing (`src/core/services/csv-parser.ts`):**
    *   Set up a service using `papaparse` to fetch and parse the financial data from `static/data/q4_2024_financial_data_200k.csv`.
    *   The parser now processes the raw CSV data and utilizes the `calculateCountryLevelMetrics` function to return a map of aggregated data by country.

4.  **State Management (`src/core/stores/financial.svelte.ts`):**
    *   Created a Svelte store to manage the application's state.
    *   The store includes writables for `financialData`, `selectedCountry`, and `selectedTimePeriod` to make financial data and user selections globally accessible.

5.  **Utility Functions (`src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts`):**
    *   Added `formatCurrency` to display numerical values in a condensed format (e.g., `1234` becomes `1.2K`).
    *   Added `formatPercentage` to correctly format percentage values.

6.  **Configuration (`.gitignore`):**
    *   Updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude the large CSV data file (`q4_2024_financial_data_200k.csv`) from version control.

### Files Created/Modified:

*   **Created:** `src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts` - Contains all business logic for data aggregation and formatting.
*   **Created:** `src/core/stores/financial.svelte.ts` - Manages global state for financial data and filters.
*   **Modified:** `src/core/types/financial.ts` - Added and refined all necessary TypeScript data structures.
*   **Modified:** `src/core/services/csv-parser.ts` - Updated to parse the correct data file and use the new aggregation logic.
*   **Modified:** `tasks/tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md` - Updated to reflect the completion of Task 1.0 and its sub-tasks.
*   **Modified:** `.gitignore` - Added the new data file to the ignore list.

All changes were committed to the repository under the message: `feat: setup financial data models and CSV data processing`.
