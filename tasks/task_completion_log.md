## Completed Task: 1.0 Set up financial data models and CSV data processing

This session focused on establishing the foundational data layer for the Financial Performance Dashboard. All sub-tasks associated with Task 1.0 in `tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md` were completed.

### Summary of Work:

1.  **Data Modeling (`src/core/types/financial.ts`):**

    - Defined TypeScript interfaces for core financial metrics (`FinancialMetrics`).
    - Created interfaces for `Country` and `ProfitCenter` data structures.
    - Added a `FinancialData` interface to represent a single row from the source CSV.
    - Introduced an `AggregatedFinancials` interface for summarized data.
    - Established a `TimeSeriesData` structure to hold monthly aggregated values.

2.  **Data Processing and Aggregation (`src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts`):**

    - Implemented `aggregateFinancials` to sum up financial data records.
    - Created `calculateCountryLevelMetrics` to aggregate the raw data by country and calculate key metrics like Operating Margin and Return on Equity.
    - Added `calculateProfitCenterMetrics` to perform similar aggregations for profit centers within a specific country.

3.  **CSV Parsing (`src/core/services/csv-parser.ts`):**

    - Set up a service using `papaparse` to fetch and parse the financial data from `static/data/q4_2024_financial_data_200k.csv`.
    - The parser now processes the raw CSV data and utilizes the `calculateCountryLevelMetrics` function to return a map of aggregated data by country.

4.  **State Management (`src/core/stores/financial.svelte.ts`):**

    - Created a Svelte store to manage the application's state.
    - The store includes writables for `financialData`, `selectedCountry`, and `selectedTimePeriod` to make financial data and user selections globally accessible.

5.  **Utility Functions (`src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts`):**

    - Added `formatCurrency` to display numerical values in a condensed format (e.g., `1234` becomes `1.2K`).
    - Added `formatPercentage` to correctly format percentage values.

6.  **Configuration (`.gitignore`):**
    - Updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude the large CSV data file (`q4_2024_financial_data_200k.csv`) from version control.

### Files Created/Modified:

- **Created:** `src/core/utils/financial-calculations.ts` - Contains all business logic for data aggregation and formatting.
- **Created:** `src/core/stores/financial.svelte.ts` - Manages global state for financial data and filters.
- **Modified:** `src/core/types/financial.ts` - Added and refined all necessary TypeScript data structures.
- **Modified:** `src/core/services/csv-parser.ts` - Updated to parse the correct data file and use the new aggregation logic.
- **Modified:** `tasks/tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md` - Updated to reflect the completion of Task 1.0 and its sub-tasks.
- **Modified:** `.gitignore` - Added the new data file to the ignore list.

All changes were committed to the repository under the message: `feat: setup financial data models and CSV data processing`.

## Completed Task: 2.0 Create country-level financial overview interface

Implemented the main dashboard UI and table component for displaying aggregated financial metrics by country.

### Summary of Work:

1. **Dashboard Route (`src/routes/(dashboard)/+page.svelte`):**

   - Created new route that parses the CSV data on mount and populates the financial store.
   - Renders the `FinancialTable` component once data is loaded.

2. **Financial Table Component:**

   - Added `src/components/financial-table/financial-table.svelte` with sticky headers, zebra striping and right-aligned numeric columns.
   - Displays all required metrics and a computed Grand Total row.
   - Exported via `src/components/financial-table/index.ts`.

3. **CSV Parser Update:**

   - Adjusted `src/core/services/csv-parser.ts` to load `q4_2024_financial_data.csv`.

4. **Task List Update:**
   - Marked all subtasks under 2.0 as completed in `tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md`.

### Files Created/Modified:

- **Created:** `src/components/financial-table/financial-table.svelte` - Reusable table for displaying financial metrics.
- **Created:** `src/components/financial-table/index.ts` - Exports the table component.
- **Created:** `src/routes/(dashboard)/+page.svelte` - Dashboard route rendering the country overview table.
- **Modified:** `src/core/services/csv-parser.ts` - Fetches the correct CSV file.
- **Modified:** `tasks/tasks-prd-mvp-financial-dashboard.md` - Updated to mark task 2.0 complete and corrected data file reference.

All changes committed with message `feat: add country overview table`.
